# Guess-My-Number-Application
Simple, single player, browser-based number guessing game

This application was developed interactively with online instructor Jonas Schmedtmann through his course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Hero" on Udemy. The application is used to teach some important concepts regarding the inplementation of JavaScript functionality to HTML/CSS documents, the adding and altering to these documents to achieve a certain end goal, DOM manipulation, and so on.

This application is a simple, single player game in which, upon loading, a random number will be assigned as the "target number" for the player to try guessing. The player will begin by typing a number between 1 and 20 into the dialogue box and hitting the "Check!" button. The page will provide immediate feedback to the player's input, which consists of three types: telling the player that their guess is "Too Low!", telling the player that their guess is "Too High!", or telling the player that their guess is "Correct!" If correct, the screen will also turn a bright green to indicate a successful match. The game allows for replays by clicking the "Again!" button and for tracking of a player's high score between games.

*It should be noted that students of the course are given base templates for the application, within which the student will make all appropriate changes and additions. Therefore, to avoid plagiarism, Jonas Schmedtmann is the rightful owner of the HTML and CSS templates used in this project.*
